# Earthquake Data Visualization

# Introduction
This project visualizes earthquake data on an interactive map using Leaflet. The app displays worldwide earthquakes with a magnitude above 4.5 within the last within the last7 days using information about their location, magnitude, depth, and time, retrieved from the USGS Earthquake API.

# Installation
